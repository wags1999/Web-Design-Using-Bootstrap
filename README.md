# Introduction to Web Design Using Bootstrap
Files for the REACH High Spring 2016 course: Intro to Web Design Using Bootstrap

This class requires no prior experience, and starts with the very basics of writing HTML.  Throughout the class, students work on
exercises to build a fully functioning web site for a fictional company.  The class covers basic CSS for styling 
and JavaScript for interactivity.  We then add Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and JQuery to extend our website and make it responsive.
The class then adds content, including images, forms, and an embedded Google map.  Lastly, we add a Bootstrap Carousel and animations 
to make the site look really great.

Slides used in classroom lectures are in the Slides folder.
